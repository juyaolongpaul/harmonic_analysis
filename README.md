This [website](https://juyaolongpaul.github.io/harmonic_analysis/) is dedicated the paper "An Interactive Workflow for Generating Chord Labels for Homorhythmic Music in Symbolic Formats", which is presented at the 20th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference at Delft, Netherlands, 2019. The complete documentation is divided into a few sections which locate at the navigation bar of the website, where you can find the installation guide to run the code, and complimentary materials for the paper. 

If you have any questions, please send me an email to `yaolong.ju@mail.mcgill.ca`.
