overall slice 1443
difference 202
gt r 150
pre r 96
both w 11

(this is based on the assumption that the rest of gt where it is the same with are all correct, which is not the case)
overall gt acc = (1443-52/1443) = 96.40%
overall pre acc = 1337/1443 = 92.65% (96% of quality of the original gt quality)(need to reduct both wrong case, this is when c c, but both wrong! it should be very very very small! neglectable!)
both wrong rate = 11 (this is when both are different and all wrong)
