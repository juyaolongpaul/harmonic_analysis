## Examples of the Results

The program can output the predicted results (you can find them at `./predicted_result/ISMIR2019/`), along with the ground truth annotations, into musicXML files. The figure below is an example:

There are 10 rows underneath the score. The first one is the ground truth chord labels, the third one is the chord label generated by Model 2, the fourth one is the chord label generated by Model 3. The fifth and sixth ones are the NCTs from the ground truth and the ones predicted by MLA, respectively. The seventh one is the chord label generated by Model 1. The ninth one is the chord label generated by the algorithm ensemble. The tenth one is the chord label generated by the rule-based model. The second and eighth ones are for internal usage, which you don't need to understand. Note that all the chord labels that have "âœ“" means they are the correct chord labels.
